  <p>T-ZONE is the annual tech fest of GIHSM which has been our pride for more than an year now. Since its inception in 2017, it has been a part and parcel of lives at GIHSM. Students from different departments come and participate enthusiastically in this one day event. This is the time when everyone works together as a team and is dedicated towards a common goal to bring pride and honor to the department. "Division Of Labour" is followed here at every step. This keeps the students mentally prepared to perform well in the companies and prepares them to take responsibilities and live upto the expectations. After the one day of long grilling experience, students are awarded and appreciated for participating and winning in the fest.</p>
